Theodore's Note:

Hello! For the past week, I've been building this weather app with a completed front and backend, included with SQLite, JSON Web Tokens, Cookie History, and Node.js with Express. One fault I had with this app though was creating a 5-day forecast instead of a 7-day one. After building the weather app, I realized I was using the 5-day API instead of the One Call API from OpenWeather.

To run this application, clone this repository with an IDE like VSCode. 
1. cd .\server\
2. npm start
3. cd ..
4. npm run dev
5. Open http://localhost:3000/

Step 2 builds the backend, while Step 4 builds the front end. Definetely had a much harder time with the backend, and making sure that the Sign In page showed first. This was a fun challenge, though. Thank you! Looking forward to chating with you!


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
